\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}
\begin{abstract}
  The Department of Computer Science of the Univerisity College London(UCL) is strongly interlinked with business all over the world, collaborating and providing workforce and young talents for the industry. The Industry Exchange Network is an online platform which facilitates interaction and communication between SME’s, International Corporations and Charities by showcasing UCL Computer Science students’ projects.
  The website is built on the languages of HTML, SCSS, JavaScript. All the content of the IXN website is managed by Dr Yun Fu (Teaching Fellow and App Project Manager at UCL). To facilitate the upload and update of material a Content Management System (CMS) was needed and requested. The Back-End is based on a customized WordPress management system, which is based upon a PHP framework running on a Microsoft Azure server.
  The team was able to successfully deploy the website within the date agreed with the client. The clients’ requests were all fulfilled together with the “must have” and “should” have sections of the MoSCoW. The apparent results and feedback obtained were positive. The client was pleased by the aesthetics and functionality of the website. However, only the future interactions between the Computer Science department and the forthcoming industrial partners will tell if the IXN website project has been successful or not.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

This report describes the creation of the new Industry Exchange Network
website showcasing UCL Computer Science student's projects and marketing
the organisation to attract new industry partners.

\hypertarget{the-client}{%
\subsection{The Client}\label{the-client}}

The IXN project was appointed by Dr Yun Fu, a Teaching Fellow, App
Project Manager and Student Internship Manager at University College
London (UCL). An important part of Dr Fu's profession is to connect
students to the industry, therefore, having a website to showcase the
work done by the Computer Science department to the industry is
significant. Consequently, the Industry Exchange Network (IXN) website
was commissioned with the intent to bridge the gap between students and
industry

\hypertarget{the-project}{%
\subsection{The Project}\label{the-project}}

The Industry Exchange Network website allows UCL Computer Science
students to get involved with term-based client projects \cite{g1}. The
website showcases a variety of student projects, ranging from 1st Year
Students to the more advanced MSc Data Science endeavours. The clients
are entrepreneurs, charities, healthcare companies, researchers, SMEs,
the government and large enterprises. The IXN website is a platform to
allow individuals in the industry to get in touch with the members of
the IXN team. The main objective of the website, therefore, is to market
IXN to professionals; showcasing the abilities of UCL Computer Science
students.

\hypertarget{team-coordination}{%
\subsection{Team Coordination}\label{team-coordination}}

In team projects, good organisation is fundamental to effective
collaboration. Productivity tools and workflow management has been key
to the team working efficiently. The key technologies used by the IXN
team included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Slack:} allowing team members to communicate. Chosen due to
  its ability to share files, track conversations via thread and create
  alerts
\item
  \textbf{Trello:} used as a dashboard to distinguish between work to be
  done, in progress or completed
\item
  \textbf{OneDrive:} used as a cloud sharing tool
\item
  \textbf{GitHub:} used to share code between developers, provide
  version control, manage conflicts and deploy the site to the live
  server. A private repository provided by UCL was used to keep any work
  out of the public domain
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{scheduling}{%
\subsection{Scheduling}\label{scheduling}}

Work packages were allocated according to each team members' strengths
and weaknesses. Jobs were distributed to optimise team members time
while allowing all individuals to learn. A Gantt chart was used to map
out the timeline of the project to keep tasks on track and manage
deadlines. Figure \ref{gantt}, shows a slimmed down version of the Gantt
chart used.

\hypertarget{design-process}{%
\section{Design Process}\label{design-process}}

In order to be able to complete the project to both a high standard an
within a timely manner, a design process was following both process and
agile design methods to reach the projects objectives. The project was
spilt into three phases: \emph{definition, design} and
\emph{development}. Figure \ref{designprocess}, shows an overview of the
projects workflows and a breakdown of the key steps of each phase.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.98\textwidth]{DesignProcess.eps}
\caption{Diagram illustrating the design process progressing the from the initial briefing to implementation}
\label{designprocess}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{definition-phase}{%
\subsection{Definition Phase:}\label{definition-phase}}

This phase focused on collecting requirements and defining the
objectives of the project. In order to capture all the information
correctly, several meetings were held with the client these meetings
meetings were used to capture the main features of the site, creating
and organising the content that would be displayed. User research was
then embarked, refining the objectives and content of the site. These
stages all worked towards providing all the prior research required to
begin designing, prototyping and envisioning how the website would
function.

\hypertarget{design-phase}{%
\subsection{Design Phase:}\label{design-phase}}

The design phase applied human computer interaction (HCI) principles in
an agile to approach, to mock up variety of different solutions and
refine the solutions quickly. By following of the process of creating
sketches of different components of the website, whittling these
sketches down to wireframes and prototypes. Solutions could be quickly
tested by the designers, client and user groups providing feedback to
take back and learn upon, improving the overall design of the website
until a rough solution was generated which met both the design
objectives and the met HCI objectives. Spending time before writing any
code was key to making sure the solution was user friendly and visual
meeting one of the key objectives of the project. After rough solution
was created through user interface (UI) design cycle, this was then
padded out and refined creating a static draft of the design which could
be directly copied in the development phase. A large amount of time
could be saved in the development phase of the project by having a
finalised design template to work of which included the typography,
components and the page layouts of the site.

\hypertarget{development-phase}{%
\subsection{Development Phase:}\label{development-phase}}

Development was the final phase of the project. A complete understanding
of how the final product will look and function, based on the research
conducted in the definition phase and the detailed design template in
the design phase meant that all the technology required to required to
implement the solution can be selected. A local development environment
shared amongst all the developers enabled the use of an agile build
cycle, using git to mediate between the different versions. The build
cycle consisted of a developer taking a UI component from the template
and creating the design in code. This would then be connected to the PHP
database using word-press and the tested. Any bugs in either the design
or functionality could then be ironed out through iteration through the
cycle eventually integrating all the components together into the final
site. Once the entire design template was implemented the project could
then be deployed onto the web.

\hypertarget{client-requirements}{%
\subsection{Client Requirements}\label{client-requirements}}

The requirements of the website were highlighted in the first meeting
with Dr Yun Fu. The existing website for the IXN network was shown to
the group and presented design, content and responsiveness issues. In
fact, the aim of the Industry Exchange Network website is to be guide
and convince industry leaders to join by contacting the administrators,
such a problematic website was not suitable to represent the Computer
Science department at UCL. Therefore, new website had to be a high
quality exemplification of what the department is able to do and the
following features were required by the client:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  High quality and professional design
\item
  Fully responsive website
\item
  Content management system to allow the Administrator to update the
  website without touching code
\item
  Separate sections for Events, News and Featured Projects.
\item
  A navigation bar always present at the top of the website
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{types-of-requirements}{%
\subsection{Types of Requirements}\label{types-of-requirements}}

There are two types of requirements web development: functional and
non-functional. The former, are ones which define specific tasks and
activities the project must be able to perform. The latter, are ones
which outline the way a system operates and strongly related to the
architecture of the system \cite{g5}. Due to the nature of a website
used to showcase projects which have already been made, most of the
requirements fall under the functional category, nonetheless, the most
important ones of both types for IXN website are summarised below:

\hypertarget{functional-requirements}{%
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}\label{functional-requirements}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Professional and highly polished design suitable for the business
  environment
\item
  Displaying news related and events related to the Industrial Exchange
  network
\item
  Showcasing projects made by the CS department through images and
  videos
\item
  A navigation bar which is always present at the top of the webpage
\item
  Displaying partners of the IXN
\item
  Project Sorting tool
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{non-functional-requirements}{%
\subsubsection{Non-functional
Requirements}\label{non-functional-requirements}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Content Management System to be able to update the website without
  having to modify the code directly.
\item
  Scalability when inserting new projects, news and events
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{moscow}{%
\subsection{MoSCoW}\label{moscow}}

To distinguish between Must Have requirements, Should and Could Haves
the team used a MoSCoW analysis framework \cite{g4}. The tool was
constructed by combining statistics extracted form a questionnaire posed
to UCL students, Client Requirements, Personas and Use Cases. A well
developed MoSCoW facilitates the implementation and design of a project
by streamlining the creation and implementation processes. Below in
figure ``X'' the MoSCoW of the IXN project is displayed:

\hypertarget{user-definition}{%
\section{User Definition}\label{user-definition}}

\hypertarget{round-one-user-feedback}{%
\subsection{Round One User Feedback}\label{round-one-user-feedback}}

Evaluation is concerned with gathering the usability of a design or a
product by a specified group of users within a specified environment or
work context. A first round of user surveys was taken based on sketches
in order to assess essential site content. The results were used to
inform a MoSCoW, storyboards, and subsequent sketches. The results of
the survey are outlined below:

\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.7\textwidth]{ph3.png}
      \caption{IXN network round one User Feedback result summary}
\label{userfeedback}
 \end{figure}

As can be seen, the features which were given highest importance were
project-related features and IXN information-related features.
\ref{userfeedback} In addition to these content-related attributes, it
also became evident that a design-quality would be of utmost importance,
given that industry individuals who are thinking of relying on IXN for
their ventures would feel inclined to participate after seeing past
projects displayed in a skilled and professional way.

\hypertarget{related-research}{%
\subsection{Related Research}\label{related-research}}

Related research was highly important due to the red tape imposed by
regulations at UCL. External sources were used to understand the type of
audience that the website would appeal to and what level of digital
ability the users typical would have. The image below outlines the
outcomes of such research:

\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.7\textwidth]{p21.png}
      \caption{Summarized statistics extracted from the readings explaied below}
 \end{figure}

Data providing a fuller picture of the demographics of IXN Students was
found primarily using UCL student statistics \cite{ps1}. This
information was provided on the UCL website. It was determined that the
IXN student audience is typically British and male. This evidence helped
us develop a data-driven persona. The client indicated that this is not
a target-user, but never the less, user research determined that UCL IXN
students would be an audience regardless of the website's intent since
they would like to see their work, the work of other students, and
possible industry partners.

The client's target audience for the IXN site was potential and current
partners. Based on the assigned projects for GC02 during the current
term, the partners tend to be from technology companies and charity
institutions.

Research was done on the demographics of a typical charity volunteer/
employee in the United Kingdom using sources such as The Charity
Commission \cite{ps2} and National Council for Voluntary Organisations
\cite{ps3}. Based on worked published from these organisations, it was
determined that the typical charity employee is aged 45 or older and
usually holds a degree. A persona and use-case was developed regarding
this data. This data also indicated that the site should be streamlined
and simple without confusion on how to navigate through different pages.

In order to obtain a profile for a technology employee, sources such as
the Atlantic \cite{ps4} and The Harvard business review \cite{ps5} were
utilised. The research indicated that employees at such businesses are
typically males in their early to mid-thirties. This data was, again,
used to inform a persona/use-case scenario. It was determined that this
type of user is typically technology-proficient and that the site should
reflect the high calibre of technical capability of IXN students.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

The main limitations were imposed by the HCI department which did not
allow surveys to be taken from those other than immediate family members
or UCL CS students. Fortunately, in the case of the Industrial Exchange
Network, UCL Computer Science students account for a high percentage of
users. Had more time and leniency been given for user research, a
broader audience could have been surveyed resulting in a more in-depth
study of user requirements. Having a budget to dedicate to research
could have also helped to obtain more statistically significant results.
For example, questionnaires could have been sponsored to attract a
larger public to complete them.

\hypertarget{users-and-personas}{%
\subsection{Users and personas}\label{users-and-personas}}

Based on client specification and demographics research, 5 personas were
created to gain understanding of the end user of the product. Please
refer to Figure ``X'' in the Appendix for detailed personas. The two
main user categories that were focused on were: ​

• Technology industry employees: ​ - Digital Native Users who have got
strong tech background​ - Look for a business opportunity​ - High
expectations from design and quality of website​ - The platform has to
appear professional for them to be incentivised to join IXN​.

The main design principles were considered for this specific persona
were: ​ consistency: essential for a professional looking website​
affordance: for an intuitive interaction with the platform. ​

\begin{figure}[H]

      \includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.7\textwidth]{ph1.png}
      \caption{SME Tech Enterprise Owner}
\end{figure}

• UCL Computer Science Students: ​ - Highly trained digital users​ -
They require the projects they have worked on to be very visible​ -
Expect to be well represented by the design of the website​ - They
desire the platform to be as entertaining as possible. ​

The main design principle was considered for this specific persona was:
​ visibility: especially in relation to how the projects are showcased.
​

Use Cases

Use cases were constructed to represent the standard user navigation and
interaction with the platform needed to accomplish a given task
\cite{g3}. These were useful to shape the development and design of the
website, facilitating the interaction between the website and its users.
In the case of the IXN website the role of the administrator was also
taken into account.

An outline of the use cases can be found below. This is essentially a
list of the actions realated to the Must and Should sections of the
MoSCoW. To avoid repetition, the main routes (in bold) have been
outlined in detail.

\hypertarget{ui-design-cycle}{%
\subsection{UI Design Cycle}\label{ui-design-cycle}}

After the initial debrief with the client, describing what the Industry
exchange Network does and the primary website requirements, the HCI
design process began. Initial research into competing solutions revealed
that there was no exact equivalent to IXN. However, there were specific
features of similar sites that would later inspire IXN content, such as
``How to use'' sections, ``Events'' sections and prominent placement of
industry links.

Based on initial research including competing solutions, initial user
surveys and client meetings, a shortlist of potential user types was
obtained and was used to inform several personas and use-case scenarios.
Throughout the entire research process, iterations of hand-drawn
sketches were made in an attempt to hone in on an ideal data-driven
design. Additionally, storyboards were made to outline specific user
experiences.

After the second round of user feedback, a MoSCow requirements table was
defined in order to inform several generations of wireframes.
Down-selection of such wireframes gave way to an initial prototype which
was then scrutinised via Heuristic and Think-Aloud user evaluation. The
final prototype that inspired the IXN website design was developed over
several iterations based on all of the data obtained during the HCI
portion of the course.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.98\textwidth]{UIDesign.png}
\caption{UI Design Cycle}
\label{UIDesign}
\end{figure}

Various tools were used to turn handmade sketches into a final
prototype. The table below explains which methods have been used and the
reason they have been chosen:

\begin{table}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.98\textwidth]{ph19.png}
      \caption{Prototyping methods and tools used}
 \end{table}

\hypertarget{detailed-design}{%
\subsection{Detailed Design}\label{detailed-design}}

Sketch was used to make the final prototype, which was then employed
directly in front-end development. Each member of the team took
responsibility for designing both the web and mobile views for
particular components of the IXN site. In Sketch, both Symbols and UI
Components sheets were made, housing key design elements of the site in
order to avoid redundancy and maintain consistency throughout the site.
Sketch's ability to produce exportable CSS code based on prototype
design elements made the tool particularly useful during the
implementation stage of development. An example would be the IXN
website's section headings. A symbol was created in order to maintain a
consistent design of this feature for all of the sections on the
homepage and throughout the external pages.

After components were individually designed, the team came together to
ensure a cohesive flow was maintained throughout the site. Small tweaks
were made to individual components in order to ensure a consistent user
experience across every part of the IXN website. After this
collaborative effort concluded, front-end development commenced.

\hypertarget{technical-research}{%
\section{Technical Research}\label{technical-research}}

\hypertarget{content-management-system}{%
\subsection{Content Management System}\label{content-management-system}}

A content management system (CMS) is a piece of software which provides
a level of automation for the tasks required to manage content
efficiently. It is usually server-based, interacting with content stored
in a repository; which can be located on the same server \cite{p1}. In
web development, the ultimate purpose of such tools is to allow an
administrative user to edit the content on a website without having to
append code files directly.

The CMS used for the IXN project was WordPress. There are other free,
open-source CMS options, such as Drupal or Joomla, but WordPress was
selected due to a few critical advantages.These can be boiled down to:

\begin{enumerate}

\tightlist
\item
  Better support options and availability
\item
  Superior access to themes and add-ons
\item
  Easy website maintenance.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{support-options-and-availability}{%
\subsubsection{Support Options and
Availability~}\label{support-options-and-availability}}

WordPress support is available on a plethora of developer channels for
web developers and beginners alike on a myriad of platforms. These
include docs, handbooks, codex, Slack channels and Stack Exchange to
name a few. Being the most popular CMS, there are entire websites
dedicated to supporting in addition to thousands of online tutorials.
Unlike WordPress, finding expert support for Joomla or Drupal is more
difficult. All of the platforms provide extensive primary source
documentation, but~because of WordPress's popularity, it outshines its
competitors as far as ease of access to efficient troubleshooting.~

\hypertarget{access-to-themes-and-add-ons}{%
\subsubsection{Access to themes and
add-ons~}\label{access-to-themes-and-add-ons}}

While Drupal and Joomla also both offer themes and add-ons, the access
and variety are not comparable to WordPress, which offers around 40,000
additional plugins. In Joomla, there is a feature that allows users to
install extensions. However, to access a template, a user would still
have to manually search templates and then install them by adding their
URL, more arduous than WordPress streamlined process using the
dashboard. Worse still, Drupal users have to exit their site, search for
a specific module or theme, find a zip file URL and submit the URL to
the Modules or Themes page to install them.~

Not only does WordPress take minutes to install, but also the dashboard
interface after the install is simple and easy to navigate \cite{p3}.
This is especially useful if you are developing a simple site for a
client and they want to be able to manage and modify the site's content
easily. Updating Wordpress is a seamless process often requiring no
developer interaction. It should also be mentioned that To increase
accessibility, WordPress offers a mobile app that users can download to
monitor and update their site. Joomla's post-install panel less
intuitive, partly due to offering many more features out of the box
\cite{p2}. Seasoned web developers may~prefer this, but for simplicity,
WordPress wins out. Drupal offers users \emph{`distributions'},
particular to the type of site that they want to develop. This could be
a bit confusing for beginners. Finally, Drupal's updates can require
developer knowledge \cite{p4}.

\hypertarget{roots-technology-stack-sage-bedrock-and-trellis}{%
\subsection{Roots Technology Stack: Sage, Bedrock and
Trellis}\label{roots-technology-stack-sage-bedrock-and-trellis}}

Traditionally, Wordpress app development and deployment involves
installing Apache, My SQL and PHP locally, often installed using
software such and MAMP or WAMP. Servers (particularly shared hosting
providers) often provide WordPress installs using a one-click install
method. This prevents the developer having to configure installation and
setup of the production server remotely but limits files to be uploaded
via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) only. This method has many limitations
and is highly unsuitable for professional website development. Some of
the limitations include:

\begin{enumerate}

\tightlist
\item
  No relationship between local and production files creating
  duplication of work
\item
  Databases between local and production will be different and hard to
  sync across
\item
  If an error occurs when updating production files, the entire
  production site can be corrupted suspending the websites service to
  users
\item
  FTP sites can be very slow to load and update
\item
  Plugins and backend changes have to be completed through the control
  panel and no WP-CLI access is provided \cite{p13}
\end{enumerate}

The Root's open source technologies instead provide a different more and
superior approach to Wordpress app development; through creating
development and production environments, ensuring that production
environments server match the development virtual machine precisely.

To illustrate; after creating a new theme or plugin for a Wordpress site
on a local server, it is time to deploy. The Sage starter theme offer
out of the box code optimisation technology which requires compiling.
Through typing a single line of code a developer can install or update
all the correct version of the plugin on the production site, compile
assets, update the theme on the remote server, and then ensure the
plugin has been activated on the production site while maintaining the
database between the local and development sites. Through using Sage,
Bedrock and Trellis in unison, the process of developing, testing and
deploying can be reduced to a fraction of the time while the site can be
fully optimised and remain online and stable. The following subsections
give more detail to the three Roots technologies:

\hypertarget{bedrock}{%
\subsubsection{Bedrock}\label{bedrock}}

Bedrock is a modern WordPress stack that brings more automation to web
development and site maintenance and does so using a better folder
structure, see Figure \ref{bedrockfolder}. It uses PHP \emph{.dotenv}
for environment variables, which are part of the twelve-factor app
\cite{p6}, a methodology created by Heroku for building web
apps\cite{p5}. The main goal of this methodology is to improve work on a
growing codebase
\footnote{The details of underlying principles of this methodology are beyond the scope of this work but can be found in \cite{p8}.}.

\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.85\textwidth]{ph20.png}
      \caption{Difference between Bedrock and standard Wordpress Structure}
\label{bedrockfolder}
 \end{figure}

Composer, a tool for dependency management in PHP, is used to pull in
both *.dotenv and WordPress, along with WordPress plugins \cite{p7}.
Suppose a developer has a project that depends on some libraries and
some of those libraries depend on other libraries. In essence, Composer
allows the developer to declare the libraries they depend on and finds
out the correct versions of packages needed and installs them into the
project \cite{p8}.

\hypertarget{trellis}{%
\subsection{Trellis}\label{trellis}}

Trellis is a Wordpress development and production server tool which
creates and manages these machines. Trellis makes use of Ansible, using
this software for automation of cloud provisioning, configuration
management, application deployment, and many other IT needs \cite{p12}.
These are automated across both local and production servers. To create
a local environment, a machine must be provisioned on top of a
virtualiser, such as VMWare or VirtualBox. Vagrant is then used to
implement these development environments. It is a virtual environment
manager with a focus on automation \cite{p10}. Vagrant provides work
environments that are easy to configure, reproducible, and transportable
controlled by a single reliable workflow. Then, industry-standard
provisioning tools such as shell scripts, Chef, or Puppet, can
automatically install and configure software on the virtual machine
\cite{p10}.

The combination of the Bedrock structure and Ansible automation means
that Trellis allows WordPress developers to create and manage more
professional server environments almost automatically.

\hypertarget{sage}{%
\subsubsection{Sage}\label{sage}}

Sage (sitting on top of the Trellis, Bedrock stack), provides modern
front-end development workflow designed with the idea of creating:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An advanced workflow
\item
  Minimal HTML5 templates
\item
  Theme wrappers
\item
  Handy tools such as browser sync to automatically compile and check
  code across a range of device synchronously
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{front-end}{%
\subsection{Front-End}\label{front-end}}

As the name would suggest, front-end development encompasses the
creation of the parts of a website with which the user interacts,
through the use of technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In
other words, this is where the site's content, styling and dynamic
interface is coded.

HyperText Markup Language (HTML), is the backbone of the IXN website.
This is where the site's content is kept. It is in the HTML documents
where a developer uses PHP to connect the site to the content management
system.

The site's styling was done using SCSS, a version of cascading style
sheet (CSS) written for SASS, a program written in Ruby that assembles
CSS style sheets for a browser. The advantage of using SASS is that is
has added functionality, allowing the use of variables, nested rules,
mixins and more within CSS-compatible syntax \cite{p14}.

Because the IXN website will be accessed from many different devices
with different screen sizes, responsive design principles were used
during front-end development. To achieve a consistent, responsive
interface, Bootstrap 4, a front-end web framework based on CSS styling,
was used. It has set of fixed classes that allow developers to quickly
create applications that scale to a variety of device sizes.
Additionally, Bootstrap aids developers in adding conventional
components such as navigation bars and panels to a site. It has become
the industry standard for responsive web development \cite{p15}.

To add dynamic functionality to the IXN website JavaScript (JS) was
used. JS is a front-end development language employed by many websites
and supported by all modern web browsers. JQuery is a JavaScript library
that simplifies animation, event handling and much more. It was also
used to add functionality to the IXN website \cite{p16}.

\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.8\textwidth]{ph18.png}
      \caption{Front-End and Back-End Interaction}
 \end{figure}

\hypertarget{back-end}{%
\subsection{Back-End}\label{back-end}}

Backend development refers to the server-side code written to ensure
that a site is robust and usable. This is the code that is run on the
server and is responsible for things such as database interactions,
logic, and calculations. For the IXN website, PHP was used for
server-side scripting to query a MariaDB database \cite{p17}.

Since WordPress was used as the content management system, it was also
deployed on our server so that content could be updated via the
user-friendly dashboard. This would then update the database, and
strategically placed PHP embedded in HTML would then be used to display
the content in the appropriate part of the site.

Blade by Laravel was the templating engine was used in conjunction with
PHP, after appending the file extension \emph{blade.php}. Blade employs
the concepts of template inheritance and sections. The \emph{@section}
notation allows for easy organisation of a site and can be embedded
inside HTML code. The \emph{@extends} notation can be used to inherit
other layouts. These tools are extremely convenient for effectively
organising code \cite{p18} meeting some of the design patterns further
discussed in Section \ref{design-patterns}.

\newpage

\hypertarget{system-architecture}{%
\section{System Architecture}\label{system-architecture}}

In order to be able to create a high performance website, using the
latest technologies to optimises run time and speed up the design
process; a stack of Wordpress technologies were used in three tier
system architecture. The stack was run across both local and production
servers enabling a testing environment which was fully representative of
the production server while all code could be kept offline.

The full open source Roots stack \cite{rootsweb} was selected as it
provided all the tools and structure required to develop the project to
a professional standard. Figure \ref{systemarchitecture} shows the
relationship between the three roots technologies; Sage, Bedrock and
Trellis, and their relationship to the system architecture.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.85\textwidth]{SystemArchitecture.eps}
\caption{Diagram showing the websites systems architecture, highlighting the relationship between different technologies}
\label{systemarchitecture}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{design-patterns}{%
\subsection{Design Patterns}\label{design-patterns}}

Due to the complexity of IXN's websites system architecture, multiple
design patterns were used; simplifying development workflow and improve
code readability. The Roots Sage starter theme was selected due the
being setup as was designed to offer many design pattern benefits off
the shelf. Some of the typical benefits of using design patterns
include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The ability to reuse large amounts of code \cite{deanDesignPatterns}
\item
  Capture expert knowledge from other developers where design trade offs
  have already been evaluated
\item
  Improve communication between the IXN development team
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Strategy:} This is where a family of algorithms are defined and
are made interchangeable depending on the client use case
\cite{gamma1995design}. This design pattern was used in the handling of
JavaScript files, splitting the files into common, main and custom.
Different JavaScript files would be loaded dependent on which page was
being called.

\textbf{Singleton:} This is where a class is ensured not to have anymore
than one instance \cite{gamma1995design}. When creating php
functionality for the website such as Reading Time
(\emph{reading\_time()}), found on news posts or the string chopper tool
(\emph{chop\_string()}) these classes where defied once in the
\emph{extras.php} file and then called using namespaces. This ensured
the classes was only created once and the functionality could be
accessed elsewhere in the code (see Figure \ref{ddcode}).

\textbf{Template Method:} This is where a skeleton is used to define
reusable components for subclasses \cite{gamma1995design}. This means
that subclasses can redefine certain steps of the over-aching class
without changing the codes structure. Through using the Larval
templating engine, a skeleton for each view could be defined in the
\emph{app.blade.php}, different templates files could then be selected
and swapped out depending on the page selected.

\newpage

\hypertarget{implementation}{%
\section{Implementation}\label{implementation}}

After down researching and down-selecting the most appropriate
technologies to use to meet the project and requirement goals, a
development environment shared among all the members of the team was
created. This enabled the detailed design template (created in the
design phase) to be codified into the final product. This section
discusses, the methodology and workflow of the build cycle and
deployment stages within the development phase of the project.

\hypertarget{local-development}{%
\subsection{Local Development}\label{local-development}}

Trellis was used to set up a local server to be used for the IXN
website's development. When Trellis sets up a local development
environment, it automatically creates a server, provisions it, and
installs WordPress \cite{p21}. This is done by Vagrant in Trellis, by
which a Vagrantfile uses the Ansible provisioner to run dev.yml to set
up a virtual machine on the WordPress site using VirtualBox \cite{p22} .

This was done through a few simple steps. First the site was configured
based on the WordPress Sites docs. Then,
\texttt{group\_vars/development/wordpress\_sites.yml} and
\emph{group\_vars/development/vault.yml} were edited. Finally, vagrant
up was run from the command line from the Trellis folder in the site
directory.

\hypertarget{development-tools}{%
\subsection{Development Tools}\label{development-tools}}

After prototyping using Sketch was completed, each team member took
responsibility for the development of specific sections of the site.
CodePen was used to make each component for the website before all of
the sections were integrated into the appropriate page layouts. The
benefit of using CodePen is that HTML, CSS and JavaScript code can be
written in the browser, and compiled in real time, with the result
visible in the same window. \cite{p19} Ultimately, it allows for faster
development and easy troubleshooting.

From CodePen, the front-end code was integrated into the site's pages
using text editors such as Atom and Sublime, each member had their own
preferences. This was where PHP was added. In the later stages of
development, all of the code was edited and written using text editors.

\textbf{GitHub:} Finally, GitHub was used for collaboration. Git is a
version control system, allowing revisions in the code to be stored
neatly and chronologically. The changes can then be seen by other
developers who can download and modify it. \cite{p20} GitHub is the
community of developers and where they store their work.

For the IXN website there was a group repository where code was shared
and updated. In order to organize to code and ensure the integrity of
the site, five branches were made. There was a branch made for each
individual member (Alexcode, PhoebeCode and GioCode). This is where code
was written the majority of the time. When updates were finalized, code
from these branches was then pushed to the Dev branch. After this code
was reviewed and if there were no clashes, the code was then pushed to
the master branch which housed the cleanest and most current version of
the site at any given time.

\hypertarget{build-cycle}{%
\subsection{Build Cycle}\label{build-cycle}}

The build cycle for the implementation of the Industry Exchange Program
was a process strongly based on iteration. Each team member was assigned
single components to design, construct and implement. This decision was
made to streamline and facilitate the process making the webpage. The
process the team has followed for every single component of the site can
be summarized in the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}

\tightlist
\item
  From the Prototype done by using Sketch extract the final design of
  the element to be developed, paying careful attention to the exact
  size in pixels of each one of its parts.
\item
  CodePen was used to construct the elements of the website, this tool
  was chosen because of its ability of displaying each change made to
  the HTML and CSS codes live.\\
\item
  The code created on Codepen was then transferred to a text editor and
  statically tested in the local environment to create the Front-End of
  the website. If the code did not perform well the team would fix the
  bugs starting from step 2 again.
\item
  Once the local environment displayed positive static results, PHP was
  embedded in the HTML code to enable and simplify the connection to
  WordPress and the Maria DB database.
\item
  Another element was chosen and the iterative process was followed all
  over again.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{deployment}{%
\subsection{Deployment}\label{deployment}}

To create a remote server from the remote development environment, a
couple of extra steps were needed: Provision and Deploy. Provisioning
was done in order to ensure MariaDB and Nginx were installed, Nginx was
configured, and a database was set up for the IXN site. The server was
provisioned using server.yml. Deployment was done using deploy.yml which
took the codebase from GitHub, ran Composer, created config files and
reloaded Nginx. \cite{p23}.

\hypertarget{compatibility-responsiveness}{%
\subsection{Compatibility \&
Responsiveness}\label{compatibility-responsiveness}}

The team underwent research on which browser simulators to use while for
testing compatibility and responsiveness of the IXN website.
BrowserStack because of its free trial plan and the span of emulators
was the tool chosen to perform the tests \cite{g6}. BrowserStack, in
fact, offered the possibility of testing the IXN website on a multitude
of Operating System, Devices and Browsers. Moreover, to integrate and
broaden the results of the tests the team tested the IXN project on
physical devices as well. The results obtained for desktops and laptops
are displayed below:

\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.7\textwidth]{ph7.png}
      \caption{Laptop/Desktop browser testing results}
 \end{figure}

As regards testing on mobile devices BrowserStack was the platform
chosen. Moreover, as not all of the emulators were available on free
trial, physical device testing also played a very important part. The
webpage appears fully responsive on modern software versions, however,
as occurred with the desktop devices older versions of software (around
2012/2013) struggle with the desing, SCSS and Bootstrap 4. The mobile
testing results are displayed below:

\begin{figure}[H]

      \includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.7\textwidth]{ph8.png}
      \caption{Laptop/Desktop browser testing results}
 \end{figure}

\hypertarget{server-stability-issues}{%
\subsection{Server Stability Issues}\label{server-stability-issues}}

The team has encountered issues in launching the website trough
Microsoft Azure. The website sporadically shows that the page is not
redirecting properly or that the page is in a redirect loop. The problem
seems to disappear after the page is reloaded a second time. The team
was not able to fix this matter. Future teams working in the IXN project
will have to improve the relationship between the website and the Azure
servers to increase stability and avoid the occasional redirect errors.

\hypertarget{acceptance-testing}{%
\subsection{Acceptance Testing}\label{acceptance-testing}}

The IXN User Acceptance Testing (UAT) has been generated around the
requirements of the website \cite{g7} . In fact, Use Cases have been
used to pick and prepare tasks for users to perform while testing. The
procedure the IXN team has followed for User Acceptance Testing is the
following: 1. Design tests for users to cover functional scenarios of
the website 2. Select a varied background testing team, in accordance to
the main users of the website 3. Perform the tests and record the
results 4. Bug fix with the faults encountered, or improve the defective
features features

For the IXN website UAT 35 individuals of varied technological knowledge
were asked to complete the tasks given and the time of completion was
recorded. The table below summarizes the results obtained:

\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.7\textwidth]{ph4.png}

 \end{figure}

\hypertarget{error-guessing}{%
\subsection{Error Guessing}\label{error-guessing}}

Error guessing has been put into practice by making the most of the
expertise of fellow UCL Computer Science Students. The IXN team asked
members of the department of Computer Science to come up with, consider
and assess circumstances in which the software behind the website might
have had problems in coping with the requests made. The efficiency of
this testing technique depends on the tester's abilities. In the case of
the IXN website some minor bugs were spotted in the news section.
Consequently, the team went on to fixing them.

Accomplishments}\label{requirements-accomplishments}}

When comparing the MoSCoW requirements to the team achievements, it is
evident that all of the ``Must-have'' (in green) and ``Should-have'' (in
yellow) requirements were fulfilled. An extra ``Could-have'' (in red)
feature was also included to give a more comprehensive user experience.
An annotated MoSCoW, explaining how the requirements were implemented,
can be found below:

\hypertarget{team-achievements}{%
\subsection{Team achievements}\label{team-achievements}}

Teamwork presented several advantages and disadvantages. The IXN team
faced a few challenges concerning background knowledge, workload
division and the different culture of its team members. There were times
of disagreement between team members, however, through open-minded
discussion, honesty, cooperation and respect every individual gained
valuable experience and new skills throughout the development of the
website.

While additional technical features and subtle design improvements may
have been possible with additional time, the final overall look and
functionality of the site were satisfactory given the module
constraints. Overall, the team was happy with the final result of the
IXN website.

\hypertarget{critical-evaluation-future-development}{%
\subsection{Critical Evaluation \& Future
Development}\label{critical-evaluation-future-development}}

The project was highly design-focused. Therefore, the team worked
tirelessly to make the site attractive, simple-to-use and polished.
However, site maintenance is crucial for the continued efficacy of the
site.\cite{g8} The role of future developers working on the IXN website
will, therefore, be to build upon the foundations that have already been
created. Some points of focus could be:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Improving/expanding site content: Continuously updating the latest
  projects, news, and events
\item
  Improving/expanding upon the WordPress Admin Panel: Optimizing the
  panel to exact admin specifications
\item
  Simplifying the post-adding method: Make adding new project, news and
  events posts more intuitive
\item
  Improve site speeds and performance: Optimize Azure server
  configuration and site file optimization (minifying CSS, JS etc.) to
  avoid current occasional redirect errors. Use Google site speed checks
  to find weaknesses in current performance
\item
  Improved search optimisation: Use of plugins (eg: YOAST)
\item
  Improved data analytics: Connect to client's Google analytics account
\item
  Further improvements based on more thorough user-testing: Evaluate
  user response to current site through exhaustive user-based testing to
  make a more data-driven site design and functionality
\end{itemize}

Moreover, the additional and less requested requirements of the
``Could'' section of the MoSCoW can be taken consideration and
implemented. A commented version of the ``Could'' portion, explaining
how the features can be realised, is present below:
