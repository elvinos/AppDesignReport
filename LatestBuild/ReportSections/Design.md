# Design Methodology

A design methodology was followed incorporating both agile and waterfall design processes to reach the project's objectives on time and to a high quality. The design process was split into three phases: *definition, design* and *development*. Figure \ref{designprocess}, shows an overview of the projects workflows and a breakdown of the key steps of each phase.

## Definition Phase

This phase focused on collecting requirements and defining the objectives of the project. Through attending several meetings with the client, the project's requirements were captured. These meetings obtained the main features of the site, establishing and organising the content that would be displayed. User research was then embarked, refining the objectives and content of the site. These stages all worked towards providing all the prior analysis required to begin designing, prototyping and envisioning how the website would function.

## Design Phase

The design phase applied human-computer interaction (HCI) principles in an agile to approach, to mock up a variety of different solutions and refine these solutions quickly. A process of sketching different components of the website, whittling these sketches down to wireframes then further downselecting to prototypes was followed. The designers, client and user groups tested the solutions, providing feedback and learning that was fed back into the design, improving the overall design of the website. This process was iterated multiple times until a rough solution was generated, which met both the requirements and the met HCI objectives. This process was called the user interface (UI) design cycle.

Spending time upfront to make all design decision for the website, before writing any code was key to making sure the solution was user-friendly and visual while saving a lot of time. The rough solution created by UI design cycle stage was padded out; refined into a static representation of the final look a feel of the site. This template could then be directly copied in the development phase. A large amount of time could be saved in the development phase of the project by having a finalised design template to work of which included;  typography, UI components, page layouts and mobile views of the site.

## Development Phase

Development was the final phase of the project. A complete understanding of how the final product will look and function, based on the research conducted in the definition phase and the detailed design template in the design phase meant that all the technology required to required to implement the solution can be selected. A local development environment shared amongst all the developers enabled the use of an agile build cycle, using git to mediate between the different versions. The build cycle consisted of a developer taking a UI component from the template and creating the design in code. This would then be connected to the PHP database using WordPress and the tested. Any bugs in either the design or functionality could then be ironed out through iteration through the cycle eventually integrating all the components together into the final site. Once the entire design template was implemented, the project could then be deployed on the web.
