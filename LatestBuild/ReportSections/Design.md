# Design Process

In order to be able to complete the project to both a high standard an within a timely manner, a design process was following both process and agile design methods to reach the projects objectives. The project was spilt into three phases: *definition, design* and *development*. Figure \ref{designprocess}, shows an overview of the projects workflows and a breakdown of the key steps of each phase.

## Definition Phase:

This phase focused on collecting requirements and defining the objectives of the project. In order to capture all the information correctly, several meetings were held with the client these meetings meetings were used to capture the main features of the site, creating and organising the content that would be displayed. User research was then embarked, refining the objectives and content of the site. These stages all worked towards providing all the prior research required to begin designing, prototyping and envisioning how the website would function.

## Design Phase:

The design phase applied human computer interaction (HCI) principles in an agile to approach, to mock up variety of different solutions and refine the solutions quickly. By following of the process of creating sketches of different components of the website, whittling these sketches down to wireframes and prototypes. Solutions could be quickly tested by the designers, client and user groups providing feedback to take back and learn upon, improving the overall design of the website until a rough solution was generated which met both the design objectives and the met HCI objectives. Spending time before writing any code was key to making sure the solution was user friendly and visual meeting one of the key objectives of the project. After rough solution was created through user interface (UI) design cycle, this was then padded out and refined creating a static draft of the design which could be directly copied in the development phase. A large amount of time could be saved in the development phase of the project by having a finalised design template to work of which included the typography, components and the page layouts of the site.

## Development Phase:

Development was the final phase of the project. A complete understanding of how the final product will look and function, based on the research conducted in the definition phase and the detailed design template in the design phase meant that all the technology required to required to implement the solution can be selected. A local development environment shared amongst all the developers enabled the use of an agile build cycle, using git to mediate between the different versions. The build cycle consisted of a developer taking a UI component from the template and creating the design in code. This would then be connected to the PHP database using word-press and the tested. Any bugs in either the design or functionality could then be ironed out through iteration through the cycle eventually integrating all the components together into the final site. Once the entire design template was implemented the project could then be deployed onto the web.
