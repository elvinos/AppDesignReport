## Client Requirements

The requirements of the website were highlighted in the first meeting with Dr Yun Fu. The existing website for the IXN network was shown to the group and presented design, content and responsiveness issues. In fact, the aim of the Industry Exchange Network website is to be guide and convince industry leaders to join by contacting the administrators, such a problematic website was not suitable to represent the Computer Science department at UCL. Therefore, new website had to be a high quality exemplification of what the department is able to do and the following features were required by the client:

-    High quality and professional design
-    Fully responsive website
-    Content management system to allow the Administrator to update the website without touching code
-    Separate sections for Events, News and Featured Projects.
-    A navigation bar always present at the top of the website
