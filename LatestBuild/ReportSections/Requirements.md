## Client Requirements

The primary requirements of the IXN website were highlighted in the first meeting with Dr Yun Fu.  The client explained that the aim of the Industry Exchange Network website is to encourage new industry partners to join the programme. Therefore, new website had to be a high quality example of what the department is capable of and the following features were required by the client:

-    High quality and professional design
-    Fully responsive website
-    Content management system to allow the Administrator to update the website without touching code
-    Separate pages for Events, News, Contact and Featured Projects.
-    A navigation bar always present at the top of the website

## Types of Requirements
There are two types of requirements in web development: functional and non-functional. The former define specific tasks and activities that the project must be able to perform. The latter outline the way that a system operates and strongly related to the architecture of the system \cite{g5}. Due to the nature of a website used to showcase projects, most of the requirements fall under the functional category, nonetheless, all of the most important requirements are listed below: 

### Functional Requirements

-    Professional and highly polished design 
-    Displaying news and events related to the Industry Exchange Network
-    Showcasing projects made by the CS department through images and videos
-    A navigation bar which is always present at the top of the webpage
-    Displaying partners of the IXN
-    Project Sorting tool

### Non-functional Requirements

-    Content Management System allows and admin to update the website without having to modify the code directly.
-    Scalability when inserting new projects, news and events

## MoSCoW

To distinguish between Must-Have requirements, Should and Could-Haves the team used a MoSCoW analysis framework \cite{g4}. The tool was constructed by combining statistics extracted from surveys, Client Requirements, Personas and Use Cases. A well developed MoSCoW facilitates the implementation and design of a project by streamlining the creation and implementation processes. The MoSCoW of the IXN project is displayed below:
