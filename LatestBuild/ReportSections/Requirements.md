# Requirements Definition

## Client Requirements

The requirements of the website were highlighted in the first meeting with Dr Yun Fu. The existing website for the IXN network was shown to the group and presented design, content and responsiveness issues. In fact, the aim of the Industry Exchange Network website is to be guide and convince industry leaders to join by contacting the administrators, such a problematic website was not suitable to represent the Computer Science department at UCL. Therefore, new website had to be a high quality exemplification of what the department is able to do and the following features were required by the client:

-    High quality and professional design
-    Fully responsive website
-    Content management system to allow the Administrator to update the website without touching code
-    Separate sections for Events, News and Featured Projects.
-    A navigation bar always present at the top of the website

## Types of Requirements
There are two types of requirements web development: functional and non-functional. The former, are ones which define specific tasks and activities the project must be able to perform. The latter, are ones which outline the way a system operates and strongly related to the architecture of the system \cite{g5}. Due to the nature of a website used to showcase projects which have already been made, most of the requirements fall under the functional category, nonetheless, the most important ones of both types for IXN website are summarised below:

### Functional Requirements

-	Professional and highly polished design suitable for the business environment
-	Displaying news related  and events related to the Industrial Exchange network
-	Showcasing projects made by the CS department through images and videos
-	A navigation bar which is always present at the top of the webpage
-	Displaying partners of the IXN
-	Project Sorting tool

### Non-functional Requirements

-	Content Management System to be able to update the website without having to modify the code directly.
-	Scalability when inserting new projects, news and events

## MoSCoW

To distinguish between Must Have requirements, Should and Could Haves the team used a MoSCoW analysis framework \cite{g4}. The tool was constructed by combining statistics extracted form a questionnaire posed to UCL students,  Client Requirements, Personas and Use Cases. A well developed MoSCoW facilitates the implementation and design of a project by streamlining the creation and implementation processes. Below in figure “X” the MoSCoW of the IXN project is displayed:
