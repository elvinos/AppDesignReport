# Requirements Definition

## Client Requirements

The primary requirements of the IXN website were highlighted in the first meeting with Dr Yun Fu; highlighting the IXN website aim was to encourage new industry partners to join the programme. Therefore, the new website had to be a high-quality example of the department capabilities while employing the following requirements:

-    High quality and professional design
-    Fully responsive website
-    Content management system to allow the Administrator to update the website without touching code
-    Separate pages for Events, News, Contact and Featured Projects.
-    A navigation bar always present at the top of the website

## Types of Requirements
There are two types of requirements in web development: functional and non-functional. The former define specific tasks and activities that the project must be able to perform. The latter outlines the way that a system operates and is strongly related to the architecture of the system \cite{g5}. Due to the nature of a website used to showcase projects, most of the requirements fall under the functional category. Nonetheless, all of the most important requirements are listed below:

### Functional Requirements

-    Professional and highly polished design
-    Displaying news and events related to the Industry Exchange Network
-    Showcasing projects made by the CS department through images and videos
-    A navigation bar which is always present at the top of the webpage
-    Displaying partners of the IXN
-    Project Sorting tool

### Non-functional Requirements

-    Content Management System allows an admin to update the website without having to modify the code directly.
-    Scalability when inserting new projects, news and events

## MoSCoW

To distinguish between Must-Have requirements, Should and Could-Haves the team used a MoSCoW analysis framework \cite{g4}. The tool was constructed by combining statistics extracted from surveys, Client Requirements, Personas and Use Cases. A well developed MoSCoW facilitated the implementation and design of the project by streamlining the creation and implementation processes. The MoSCoW for the IXN project is displayed below:
