# User Interface Design

## UI Design Cycle

After the initial debrief with the client, describing what the Industry exchange Network does and the primary website requirements, the HCI design process began. Initial research into competing solutions revealed that there was no exact equivalent to IXN. However, there were specific features of similar sites that would later inspire IXN content, such as "How to use" sections, "Events" sections and prominent placement of industry links. 

Based on initial research including competing solutions, initial user surveys and client meetings, a shortlist of potential user types was obtained and was used to inform several personas and use-case scenarios. Throughout the entire research process, iterations of hand-drawn sketches were made in an attempt to hone in on an ideal data-driven design. Additionally, storyboards were made to outline specific user experiences.

After the second round of user feedback, a MoSCow requirements table was defined in order to inform several generations of wireframes. Down-selection of such wireframes gave way to an initial prototype which was then scrutinised via Heuristic and Think-Aloud user evaluation.  The final prototype that inspired the IXN website design was developed over several iterations based on all of the data obtained during the HCI portion of the course. 

## Detailed Design 

Sketch was used to make the final prototype, which was then employed directly in front-end development. Each member of the team took responsibility for designing both the web and mobile views for particular components of the IXN site. In Sketch, both Symbols and UI Components sheets were made, housing key design elements of the site in order to avoid redundancy and maintain consistency throughout the site. Sketch's ability to produce exportable CSS code based on prototype design elements made the tool particularly useful during the implementation stage of development. An example would be the IXN website's section headings. (Fig) A symbol was created in order to maintain a consistent design of this feature for all of the sections on the homepage and throughout the external pages. 

After components were individually designed, the team came together to ensure a cohesive flow was maintained throughout the site. Small tweaks were made to individual components in order to ensure a consistent user experience across every part of the IXN website. After this collaborative effort concluded, front-end development commenced.
