# User Interface Design

After the initial debrief with the client, describing what the Industry exchange Network does and the primary website requirements, the HCI design process began. Initial research into competing solutions revealed that there was no exact equivalent to IXN. However, there were specific features of these sites that would later inspire IXN content, such as "How to use" sections, "Events" sections and prominent placement of industry links.

Based on initial research including competing solutions, initial user surveys and client meetings, a shortlist of potential user types was obtained and was used to inform several personas and use-case scenarios. Throughout the entire research process, iterations of hand-drawn sketches were made in an attempt to hone in on an ideal data-driven design. Additionally, storyboards were made to outline specific user experiences.

After the second round of user feedback, a MoSCow requirements table was defined in order to inform several generations of wireframes. Down-selection of such wireframes gave way to an initial prototype which was then scrutinised via Heuristic and Think-Aloud user evaluation.  The final prototype that inspired the IXN website design was developed over several iterations based on all of the data obtained during the HCI portion of the course. Sketch was used to make this final prototype, which was used directly in front-end development.
