# Introduction
This report describes the creation of the new Industry Exchange Network website showcasing UCL Computer Science student's projects and marketing the organisation to attract new industry partners.

## The Client
The IXN project was appointed by Dr Yun Fu, a Teaching Fellow, App Project Manager and Student Internship Manager at University College London (UCL). An important part of Dr Fu’s profession is to connect students to the industry, therefore, having a website to showcase the work done by the Computer Science department to the industry is significant. Consequently, the Industry Exchange Network (IXN) website was commissioned with the intent to bridge the gap between students and industry

## The Project

The Industry Exchange Network website allows UCL Computer Science students to get involved with term-based client projects \cite{g1}. The website showcases a variety of student projects, ranging from 1st Year Students to the more advanced MSc Data Science endeavours.  The clients are entrepreneurs, charities, healthcare companies, researchers, SMEs, the government and large enterprises.  The IXN website is a platform to allow individuals in the industry to get in touch with the members of the IXN team. The main objective of the website, therefore, is to market IXN to professionals; showcasing the abilities of UCL Computer Science students.

## Team Coordination

In team projects, good organisation is fundamental to effective collaboration. Productivity tools and workflow management has been key to the team working efficiently. The key technologies used by the IXN team included:

- **Slack:** allowing team members to communicate. Chosen due to its ability to share files, track conversations via thread and create alerts
- **Trello:** used as a dashboard to distinguish between work to be done, in progress or completed
- **OneDrive:** used as a cloud sharing tool
- **GitHub:** used to share code between developers, provide version control, manage conflicts and deploy the site to the live server. A private repository provided by UCL was used to keep any work out of the public domain

## Scheduling

Work packages were allocated according to each team members’ strengths and weaknesses. Jobs were distributed to optimise team members time while allowing all individuals to learn.  A Gantt chart was used to map out the timeline of the project to keep tasks on track and manage deadlines. Figure \ref{gantt}, shows a slimmed down version of the Gantt chart used.
