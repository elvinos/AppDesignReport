## Compatibility & Responsiveness

The team underwent research on which browser simulators to use while for testing compatibility and responsiveness of the IXN website. BrowserStack because of its free trial plan and the span of emulators was the tool chosen to perform the tests \cite{g6}. BrowserStack, in fact, offered the possibility of testing the IXN website on a multitude of Operating System, Devices and Browsers. Moreover, to integrate and broaden the results of the tests the team tested the IXN project on physical devices as well. The results obtained for desktops and laptops are displayed below:

 As regards testing on mobile devices BrowserStack was the platform chosen. Moreover, as not all of the emulators were available on free trial, physical device testing also played a very important part. The webpage appears fully responsive on modern software versions, however, as occurred with the desktop devices older versions of software (around 2012/2013) struggle with the desing, SCSS and Bootstrap 4. The mobile testing results are displayed below:

## Server Stability Issues

The team has encountered issues in launching the website trough Microsoft Azure. The website sporadically shows that the page is not redirecting properly or that the page is in a redirect loop. The problem seems to disappear after the page is reloaded a second time. The team was not able to fix this matter. Future teams working in the IXN project will have to improve the relationship between the website and the Azure servers to increase stability and avoid the occasional redirect errors.


## Acceptance Testing

The IXN User Acceptance Testing (UAT) has been generated around the requirements of the website \cite{g7} . In fact, Use Cases have been used to pick and prepare tasks for users to perform while testing. The procedure the IXN team has followed for User Acceptance Testing is the following:
1.	Design tests for users to cover functional scenarios of the website
2.	Select a varied background testing team, in accordance to the main users of the website
3.	Perform the tests and record the results
4.	Bug fix with the faults encountered, or improve the defective features features

For the IXN website UAT 35 individuals of varied technological knowledge were asked to complete the tasks given and the time of completion was recorded. The table below summarizes the results obtained:

## Error Guessing

Error guessing has been put into practice by making the most of the expertise of fellow UCL Computer Science Students. The IXN team asked members of the department of Computer Science to come up with, consider and assess circumstances in which the software behind the website might have had problems in coping with the requests made. The efficiency of this testing technique depends on the testerâ€™s abilities. In the case of the IXN website some minor bugs were spotted in the news section. Consequently, the team went on to fixing them.
