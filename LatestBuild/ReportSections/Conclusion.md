## Requirements Accomplishments
Comparing the initial MoSCoW to the achievements obtained by the team it is visible that all of the “Must” (in green) and “Should” (in yellow)have requirements have been fulfilled. An extra “Could” (in red) feature has been included to give a more comprehensive user experience.  An annotated MoSCoW, explaining how the requirements have been implemented, can be found below:

## Team achievements

Teamwork always has its advantages and disadvantages. The IXN team had to face some issues related to the background knowledge, the workload division and the different culture of its team members. There have been times of disagreement between team members, however, through open minded discussion, honesty and respect every individual gained experience and skills from the creation of the website and cooperating with other people.

The team was happy with the results obtained with the website, some gains in the quality of the website could have been obtained by having access to some costly design, implementation and testing tools. However, the team was proud of demonstrating that, even with a very limited budget, effort and determination can make up for not having full access to all the latest tools and platforms.

## Critical Evaluation & Future Development

The project was highly design focused. Therefore, the team tried hard to make it attractive, simple to use and professional with the latest tools and devices available at this day and age. However, in a few years’ time even all the effort put in by the team will result outdated, obsolete and the website would loose its efficacy \cite{g8} . The role of the next teams working on the IXN website will, therefore, be to build upon the foundations that have been created by updating and continuously rejuvenating the website. A task besides the design features of the website that future teams will have to take into account is to improve Azure server stability, to avoid occasional redirect errors that the website is currently facing. Moreover, the additional and less requested requirements of the “Could” section of the MoSCoW can be taken consideration and implemented. A commented version of the “Could” portion, explaining how the features can be realized, is present below:
