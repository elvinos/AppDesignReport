## Requirements Accomplishments
When comparing the MoSCoW requirements to the team achievements, it is evident that all of the “Must-have” (in green) and “Should-have” (in yellow) requirements were fulfilled. An extra “Could-have” (in red) feature was also included to give a more comprehensive user experience.  An annotated MoSCoW, explaining how the requirements were implemented, can be found below:

## Team achievements

Teamwork presented several advantages and disadvantages. The IXN team faced a few challenges concerning background knowledge, workload division and the different culture of its team members. There were times of disagreement between team members, however, through open-minded discussion, honesty, cooperation and respect every individual gained valuable experience and new skills throughout the development of the website.

While additional technical features and subtle design improvements may have been possible with additional time, the final overall look and functionality of the site were satisfactory given the module constraints.  Overall, the team was happy with the final result of the IXN website.

## Critical Evaluation & Future Development

The project was highly design-focused. Therefore, the team worked tirelessly to make the site attractive, simple-to-use and polished. However, site maintenance is crucial for the continued efficacy of the site.\cite{g8} The role of future developers working on the IXN website will, therefore, be to build upon the foundations that have already been created. Some points of focus could be:

- Improving/expanding site content: Continuously updating the latest projects, news, and events
- Improving/expanding upon the WordPress Admin Panel: Optimizing the panel to exact admin specifications
- Simplifying the post-adding method: Make adding new project, news and events posts more intuitive
- Improve site speeds and performance: Optimize Azure server configuration and site file optimization (minifying CSS, JS etc.) to avoid current occasional redirect errors. Use Google site speed checks to find weaknesses in current performance
- Improved search optimisation: Use of plugins (eg: YOAST)
- Improved data analytics: Connect to client's Google analytics account
- Further improvements based on more thorough user-testing: Evaluate user response to current site through exhaustive user-based testing to make a more data-driven site design and functionality

Moreover, the additional and less requested requirements of the “Could” section of the MoSCoW can be taken consideration and implemented. A commented version of the “Could” portion, explaining how the features can be realised, is present below:
