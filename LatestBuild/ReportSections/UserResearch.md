# User Definition

## Round One User Feedback
Evaluation is concerned with gathering data regarding the usability of a design or a product by a specified group of users within a specified environment or work context. The first round of user surveys was taken based on sketches to assess essential site content. The results were used to inform a MoSCoW, storyboards, and subsequent sketches. The results of the survey are outlined below:

\label{userfeedback}
 \end{figure}

As can be seen, the features which were given highest importance were project-related features and IXN information-related features shown in Figure \ref{userfeedback}. In addition to these content-related attributes, it also became evident that the design-quality would be of utmost importance, given that the site is meant to attract prospective industry partners.

## Related Research

Related research was highly important due to the red tape imposed by regulations at UCL. External sources were used to understand the type of audience that the website would appeal to and what level of digital ability the users would typically have. The image below outlines the outcomes of such research:

Data providing a fuller picture of the demographics of IXN Students were found primarily using UCL student statistics \cite{ps1}. This information was provided on the UCL website. It was determined that the IXN student audience is typically British and male. This evidence helped us develop a data-driven persona. The client indicated that this is not a target-user, but never the less; user research determined that UCL IXN students would be an audience regardless of the website’s intent since they would like to see their work, the work of other students, and possible industry partners.

The client’s target audience for the IXN site was potential and current partners. Based on the assigned projects for GC02 during the current term, the partners tend to be from technology companies and charity institutions.

The research was done on the demographics of a typical charity volunteer/ employee in the UK using sources such as The Charity Commission \cite{ps2} and National Council for Voluntary Organisations \cite{ps3}. Based on worked published from these organisations, it was determined that the typical charity employee is aged 45 or older and usually holds a degree. A persona and use-case were developed based on this information. This data also indicated that the site should be streamlined and simple without confusion on how to navigate through different pages.

To obtain a profile for a technology employee, sources such as the Atlantic \cite{ps4} and The Harvard Business Review \cite{ps5} were utilised. The research indicated that employees at such businesses are typically males in their early to mid-thirties. This data was, again, used to inform a persona/use-case scenario. It was determined that this type of user is typically technology-proficient and that the site should reflect the high calibre of technical capability of IXN students.

## Limitations

The main limitations were imposed by the HCI department which did not allow surveys to be taken from those other than immediate family members or UCL CS students. Fortunately, in the case of the Industrial Exchange Network, UCL Computer Science students account for a high percentage of users.  Had more time and leniency been given for user research, a broader audience could have been surveyed resulting in a more in-depth study of user requirements. Having a budget to dedicate to research could have also helped to obtain more statistically significant results. For example, questionnaires could have been sponsored to attract a larger public to complete them.

## Personas for Users

Based on client specification and demographics research, five personas were created to gain an understanding of the end user of the product. The two main user categories that were focused on were: ​

*Technology industry employees:*​

- Digital Native Users who have got strong tech background​
- Look for a business opportunity​
- High expectations from design and quality of website​
- The platform has to appear professional for them to be incentivised to join IXN​.

Consistency and affordance were the main design principles considered for this persona. These were essential for a professional looking website ​with intuitive an interaction with the platform. ​

*UCL Computer Science Students: ​*

- Highly trained digital users​
- They require the projects they have worked on to be very visible​
- Expect to be well represented by the design of the website​
- They desire the platform to be as entertaining as possible. ​

Visibility was the main design principle considered for this persona, concerning how the projects were showcased. ​

## Use Cases

Use cases were constructed to represent the standard user navigation and interaction with the platform needed to accomplish a given task \cite{g3}. These were useful in shaping the development and design of the website and facilitating the interaction between the website and its users. In the case of the IXN website, the role of the administrator was also taken into account.

An outline of the use cases can be found below. This is a list of the actions related to the Must and Should sections of the MoSCoW. To avoid repetition, the main routes (in bold) have been outlined in detail.
