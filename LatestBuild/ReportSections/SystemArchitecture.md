In order to be able to create a high performance website, using the latest technologies to optimises run time and speed up the design process; a stack of Wordpress technologies were used in three tier system architecture. The stack was run across both local and production servers enabling a testing environment which was fully representative of the production server while all code could be kept offline.

The full open source Roots stack \cite{rootsweb} was selected as it provided all the tools and structure required to develop the project to a professional standard. Figure \ref{systemarchitecture} shows the relationship between the three roots technologies; Sage, Bedrock and Trellis, and their relationship to the system architecture.
